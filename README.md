# DATA MESH

This mesh will be defined to be the infrastructure to hold the data, giving it an extra layer of security by creating a zero trust network to hold the databases and creating spefic role based authentication to the ETL to populate the databases.

The following figure explains the database architecture contained in this mesh.

## Requirements

This deployment uses a kuberntes cluster and the recomended amount of resources is 4 CPUs and 16GB of RAM for the Istio deployment to run smoothly.

## Step-by-step Deployment


After downloading Istio procced with:

- Install Istio and enable injection in the datamesh ns

```shell
istioctl install --set profile=demo -y 

```
- Set up a namespace to ensure the encapsulation of the services with mTLS. It also set the Istio sidecar injection automatically
```shell
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/base/001_datamesh-ns.yaml

kubectl label namespace datamesh istio-injection=enabled --overwrite
```
- Now we enforce the mTLS policy along the namespace we just created and we create the Istio Gateway resource pointing to localhost for local development 

```shell 
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/base/002_mtls-policy.yaml

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/base/003_gateway.yaml
```
### FHIR Server
- We can apply all the files in the [hir-services](./kubernetes/fhir-services) folder:

```shell
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/fhir-services/
```
### OMOP 

Setting up OMOP is done by creating first a postgres DB and the populating it with the vocabularies for the project. More info in [this repo](https://github.com/IDEA4RC/OMOP-Automatic-Deploy).

```shell
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/omop-services/
```

### OHDSI API

This API will anable the communication of the capsule with the Vantage 6 nodes and server.

In order to install it first a number of services must be installed to work together with the API. These are dependant of a config map that contains the connection details. (Note that the passwords must be changed in a production enviroment)

```shell
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/ohdsi-api/001_connection-details.yaml

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/ohdsi-api/sub-services/

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/omop-services/002_omop-db-cdm-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/omop-services/003_omop-db-svc-datamesh.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/omop-services/004_omop-vocab-job.yaml
```
